# Library Development Plan for `netchan` in Go

## General Goals and Principles
1. **Ease of Use**: The library's interface should be intuitively designed, reflecting the standard channel operations in Go for seamless user integration.
2. **Secure by Default**: The library must employ cutting-edge encryption techniques, alongside robust authentication and authorization practices.
3. **Scalability**: Designed with distributed systems in mind, ensuring high throughput and scalability.
4. **High Performance**: Optimized for low overhead and swift data transmissions, performance is a top priority.
5. **Network Adherence to CSP Principles**: Full alignment with the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model, extending its principles to the network layer.
6. **Principles of Pure Go Programming**: Adherence to esteemed Go programming conventions, ensuring coding practices are in harmony with the language’s philosophy.

## Package Structure
1. **Network Interaction Functions**
   - `ListenAndServe`: To handle incoming connections.
   - `Dial`: To initiate outgoing connections.
   - Both methods should utilize interfaces to facilitate future modifications and functional enhancements.

2. **Connection Management**
   - Automatic tracking of connected and disconnected clients.
   - Connection recovery in case of disconnection.
   - Client identification capabilities.

3. **Buffer and Broadcast**
   - Implementing a network-level analogue to Go’s channel buffers.
   - Broadcasting mechanism for copying initial assignments to all clients.
   - A "first-come, first-served" system for task retrieval.

4. **Channels and Encryption**
   - Initialization functions return a channel through which available channels are transmitted for servicing via `select`.
   - Employing unique encryption keys for each channel.
   - All network channels are encrypted by default.

5. **Encryption Key Storage**
   - Encryption keys used for server connection are stored inside the binary file.
   - Utilizing obfuscation and segmentation of keys, as well as the `go:embed` format, to prevent decompilation from binary code.

## Implementation
1. **Interfaces and Abstractions**: 
   - Defining interfaces for network operations, enabling easy expansion and modification of functionality.

2. **Security and Encryption**: 
   - Integration with modern encryption and security libraries.
   - Implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

3. **State Management and Error Handling**: 
   - Monitoring connection states and handling errors.
   - Automatic recovery from connection losses.

4. **Performance and Optimization**: 
   - Profiling and optimizing code to reduce overhead and accelerate data transmission.

5. **Documentation and Examples**: 
   - Providing comprehensive documentation for each function and library component.
   - Offering examples of usage for various scenarios.

6. **Testing and Validation**: 
   - Developing an extensive test suite to verify the library’s functionality.
   - Validating security and performance.

## Conclusion
By following this plan, `netchan` is poised to become a robust and flexible network interaction library in Go, ensuring high performance, security, and ease of use while adhering to the revered principles of pure Go programming.
